    Loads match data from Leaguepedia API
    Supports LEC, LPL, LCK, LCS and international tournaments

    Implementation follows Leaguepedia API best practices:
    - Uses 3 second delay between requests (recommended: 1-2s)
    - Limits queries to 500 results (API maximum for non-admins)
    - Uses ScoreboardGames/ScoreboardPlayers tables (not Players directly)
    - Uses GameId for joins (not row IDs which change on Cargo rebuild)
    - Uses __full suffix for list-type fields (e.g., Items__full)
